# TimeWorked
A simple java class that runs a scheduled timer to output the time elapsed since starting the application. A separate thread is also created in order to listen for user input as to allow the end user to enter 'x' and terminate the program when required; terminating the program in this way allows for the final elapsed time to be displayed before termination.
